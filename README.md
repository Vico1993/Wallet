# Wallet

Small cli application to help myself deal with my Crypto Wallet.
Trying to see based on my history. Which of my trade is good and which one is bad.

Also an excuse to try: [lipgloss](https://github.com/charmbracelet/lipgloss) and Golang. To make fancy CLI

## Getting started

1. Clone the project

```shell
git clone git@github.com:Vico1993/Wallet.git
```

2. Copy the `data_example.json` into `data.json`

```shell
cp data_example.json data.json
```

3. Run the script

```shell
make run
```

## Testing

You can run the unit and integration tests:

```shell
make test
```
